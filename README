# AI-Powered Multi-Model Chat Application
This is an API-based application built with **FastAPI** that facilitates conversations across multiple AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and DeepSeek. The platform allows users to start a conversation on a chosen topic, letting AI models take sequential turns to generate responses, simulating a multi-model discussion.
## Features
- **Multi-AI Model Integration**:
    - Three AI models are used (GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek) to provide diverse perspectives in a conversation.
    - Each model gives thoughtful, concise responses to the same topic.

- **Simulation of AI Dialogues**:
    - Models take consecutive turns to respond to a given topic.
    - Up to 9 turns per session are supported, alternating between models.

- **Background Processing**:
    - Conversations are processed asynchronously using FastAPI's background tasks, ensuring efficient handling of requests.

- **Logs and Storage**:
    - Conversation data, including all messages, are logged and serialized for subsequent reviews or analysis.
    - Optionally generates text files saving conversation details.
